# Next Word Prediction Model

The Next Word Prediction model is a deep learning architecture designed to anticipate the next word in a sequence of text. Using TensorFlow, a popular machine learning framework, alongside techniques like tokenization and word embeddings, the model transforms raw textual data into numerical representations that a neural network can process. Tokenization breaks down text into individual units, such as words or subwords, while embeddings map these units into dense vectors in a continuous vector space, capturing semantic relationships. The model employs LSTM (Long Short-Term Memory) layers to analyze sequential data, enabling it to grasp long-term dependencies and context within the text. A dense layer with softmax activation serves as the output layer, predicting the probability distribution of the next word in the sequence.

Once trained, the model can be deployed in various applications requiring text prediction, such as auto-completion in text editors or keyboards on mobile devices, enhancing user experience and efficiency in natural language processing tasks.
